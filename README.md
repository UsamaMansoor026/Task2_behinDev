Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to ensure the website is error-free and fully responsive. To achieve this, several modifications have been made to the CSS and JavaScript components.

CSS Changes:

1. Declared and initialized CSS variables to address the issue of undefined variables.

2. Removed unused animations to streamline the CSS file.

3. Eliminated the declaration of pointer-events property, which was set to "none," to allow for hover effects on elements.

4. Added styling for the 'open' class, which is utilized to manage the opening of the navbar on mobile devices.

5. Implemented media queries to ensure the visibility of the hamburger menu on small devices.

JavaScript Changes:

1. Implemented functionality to monitor window resize events to accommodate adjustments based on the window width.
2. Updated the click event listener for the hamburger menu to improve the styling of the bars, resulting in a perfect X (cross) appearance
